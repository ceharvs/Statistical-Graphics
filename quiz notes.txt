need to know weber's law and steven's law
need to know how to do area and volume
perceptual grouping methods.  - proximity - scatterplots and see clusters
we tend to see patterns,  proximity allows us to see similarity.  
We want to look at similar size and shape, 
enclosement - put boxes around things to show things, enclosure dominates when you see perceptual groups
attachment - if you connect lines they are thought of as a group,  this can replace enclosure.  

There are 3 kinds of color scales - q scale - equal intensity.  different hues.  For people that aren't color blind, we can tell apart hues easily.  We can find categories, good for continuous variables.  General color is a poor encoding for continuous variables.  This is okay for categories.  Colors are good if you divide continuous variables into categories.
Grey scale - might not actually be grey, but this is a reasonable scale to do on a continuous scale.
Diverging - Vlue - White - Red - Good when there is some kind of natural middle.  

We need to know how to write functions, know the four basic args to probability functions.  

rnorm(number of sameple size
rnorm(100, 
pnorm(quantile, 
* can we think of p norm as a cdf
qnorm(probabilities, 
dnorm(quantiles, 

dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)
pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
Arguments

x, q	
vector of quantiles.

p	
vector of probabilities.

n	
number of observations. If length(n) > 1, the length is taken to be the number required.

mean	
vector of means.

sd	
vector of standard deviations.

log, log.p	
logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).

lower.tail	
logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X â‰¤ x] otherwise, P[X > x].

We should also be able to do a little bit more with writing functions.
